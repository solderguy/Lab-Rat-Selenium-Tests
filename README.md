This is a Java program to test my personal website at www.pair.com/jsoper

Select pages are functionally tested with Selenium Webdriver.  

Firefox always works, most other OS/browser combinations work but a couple have issues.

Javascript and Jquery functions are also tested with Qunit, a webpage based utility controlled by Selenium.

I found three direct Qunit drivers online but only one was in a Maven repository and the documentation was incorrect.
